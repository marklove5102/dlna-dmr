An extensible DLNA DMR (Digital Media Renderer) implementation.

## 🔑 Key Differences

There already exists multiple DLNA implementations in Rust, like [crab-dlna](https://github.com/gabrielmagno/crab-dlna) etc. However, they all serve as the sending end (DMS or/and DMC), and I failed to find a decent implementation of the receiving end (DMR). So, I created one myself.

## 🤔 Cli or Lib?

The `dlna-dmr` cli itself is a dummy DMR that only logs the received commands, without actually doing anything with them. It is perfect for debugging purposes, but to build a real DMR, refer to the [library documentation](https://docs.rs/dlna-dmr/latest/dlna_dmr/).

## 📥 Installation

### Using [`binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)

```shell
cargo binstall dlna-dmr
```

### Downloading from Releases

Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/PRO-2684/dlna-dmr/releases) and download respective binary for your platform. Make sure to give it execute permissions.

### Compiling from Source

```shell
cargo install dlna-dmr
```

## 📖 Usage

To run the dummy DMR, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ dlna-dmr
[2025-05-30T14:49:48Z INFO  dlna_dmr] DMR started
[2025-05-30T14:49:48Z INFO  dlna_dmr::ssdp] SSDP server running on 172.31.117.144:1900
[2025-05-30T14:49:48Z INFO  dlna_dmr::http] HTTP server listening on 172.31.117.144:8080
[2025-05-30T14:50:11Z INFO  dlna_dmr::http] RenderingControl::SetMute channel: Master, desired_mute: false
[2025-05-30T14:50:38Z INFO  dlna_dmr::http] AVTransport::SetAvTransportUri current_uri: http://example.com/sample.mp4?param1=a&param2=b
^C
[2025-05-30T14:50:46Z INFO  dlna_dmr::http] HTTP server stopped
[2025-05-30T14:50:46Z INFO  dlna_dmr::ssdp] SSDP server stopped
[2025-05-30T14:50:46Z INFO  dlna_dmr] DMR stopped
```

To configure, simply pass in a path to a configuration file:

```shell
dlna-dmr path/to/config.toml
```

For more information on configuration options, see the documentation for [`DMROptions`](https://docs.rs/dlna-dmr/latest/dlna_dmr/struct.DMROptions.html).

## ✅ TODO

- [x] Actual XML parsing
- [x] Config file
- [x] "Heartbeat" - send periodic alive messages to the network
- [ ] Removing the `'static` requirement
- [ ] Command line arguments parsing
- [ ] Testing HTTP server via [`TestRequest`](https://docs.rs/tiny_http/0.12.0/tiny_http/struct.TestRequest.html)
